  "I have a small printing business. We design and print invitations, business cards, greeting cards, menus for local restaurants and so on. I started suspecting that one of my employees used the work equipment to print out personal files for herself and her relatives. However, I had no solid evidence of that, and other employees would not give her away. I started looking for a way to track what she printed and what she did in her work time. I spent hours searching the Internet only to find that very little software offered a solution to my problem. Most of the programs focused on monitoring the productivity of an employee. For example, they track how many tasks the person completed and how much time they spent on those tasks. However, I needed an app that will show me exactly what the employee did at any moment and, specifically, what she printed. So, after a long search, I chose Clever Control. Clever Control recorded each instance of printing, and I could always look at screenshots to see what document the employee printed. Thanks to the live viewing feature, I could watch what she was doing on her computer on my monitoring dashboard.": "I have a small printing business.
