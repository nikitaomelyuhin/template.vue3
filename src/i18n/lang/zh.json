Productivity criteria may vary not only from business to business but even from department to department and from employee to employee within the same company. Think of what performance you should see as productive, set quotas if applicable, the minimum level of performance and any other criteria that fit your business. Once you determine them, you can choose the most appropriate way of productivity tracking.": "生产力被认为是决定一个员工或团队对公司价值的关键标准。如果员工没有足够的参与，你的企业可能会失去客户并遭受经济损失。但是，在实施令人困惑的指标体系和控制每一个步骤之前，请停下来，决定什么是你企业的生产力。生产力的标准不仅在企业与企业之间可能有所不同，甚至在同一公司的不同部门和不同员工之间也可能有所不同。想一想你应该把什么表现看作是生产力，如果适用的话，设定配额，最低水平的表现和任何其他适合你企业的标准。一旦你确定了这些，你就可以选择最合适的生产力跟踪方式。",

Consider the result of the work, not how much time workers spend in the office.": "你的团队可能是世界上最守时的团队，准时到达和离开办公室。然而，他们可能把大部分的工作时间花在看Youtube上有趣的猫咪视频上，或者在喝咖啡时与同事随意聊天。相反，一个人可能总是迟到半小时--但却给公司带来最大的利益。考虑的是工作的结果，而不是工人在办公室花了多少时间。",

Speaking about the USA, most monitoring methods are legal here. The employer is free to monitor the computer and Internet usage, private messages, emails, phone calls on the company-owned devices.

According to the GDPR, you, as an employer, must notify the staff about the monitoring methods and receive their consent for data collection. You are also responsible for protecting the collected data.": "在欧洲，如果遵守GDPR法律，大多数员工监控方法是合法的。2018年5月25日出台的《通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）旨在让个人控制其数据。它适用于任何组织，并规定他们必须如何处理和保存个人的个人数据。根据GDPR，你作为雇主，必须通知员工有关监测方法，并获得他们对数据收集的同意。你也有责任保护收集的数据。",

    "GDPR does not directly address many aspects of surveillance in the workplace, such as computer, Internet usage, email and social media tracking. Here the rule of thumb is to notify the staff about the monitoring in advance through a clear internal policy and obtain their consent. The tracking methods that you use must not infringe or restrict the person's fundamental right to privacy. GDPR strictly forbids recording keystrokes and screen activity on company-owned and personal devices that the person might use for work.": "GDPR并不直接涉及工作场所监控的许多方面，如计算机、互联网使用、电子邮件和社交媒体跟踪。这里的经验法则是通过明确的内部政策提前通知员工关于监控的情况，并获得他们的同意。你所使用的跟踪方法不得侵犯或限制当事人的基本隐私权。GDPR严格禁止记录当事人可能用于工作的公司拥有的和个人设备上的击键和屏幕活动。",
    "There are similar laws in India, Canada, Nigeria, Malaysia and several other countries. The employer must have a valid reason for tracking the staff, inform the employees what data they collect and by what means and get their permission for monitoring. However, there are quite a few nuances here, depending on the country. For example, in Russia, employers can only monitor the duration of phone calls and the numbers of participants, but not the actual phone calls. In Finland, which has the strictest data protection laws, employers have very few rights for monitoring computer usage.": "在印度、加拿大、尼日利亚、马来西亚和其他一些国家也有类似的法律。雇主必须有一个有效的理由来跟踪员工，告知员工他们收集了哪些数据，通过什么方式收集，并得到他们的许可进行监测。然而，这里有相当多的细微差别，取决于不同的国家。例如，在俄罗斯，雇主只能监测电话的持续时间和参与者的数量，但不能监测实际的电话。在拥有最严格的数据保护法的芬兰，雇主在监控电脑使用方面的权利非常少。",

It is also advisable to be transparent with your staff about the reasons for monitoring, what data you collect and how you will use it.": "为了确保你公司的监控不违反任何法律，我们建议始终咨询你的地方和州法律。此外，还建议对你的员工透明地说明监控的原因，你收集哪些数据以及你将如何使用这些数据。",

    "I have a small printing business. We design and print invitations, business cards, greeting cards, menus for local restaurants and so on. I started suspecting that one of my employees used the work equipment to print out personal files for herself and her relatives. However, I had no solid evidence of that, and other employees would not give her away. I started looking for a way to track what she printed and what she did in her work time. I spent hours searching the Internet only to find that very little software offered a solution to my problem. Most of the programs focused on monitoring the productivity of an employee. For example, they track how many tasks the person completed and how much time they spent on those tasks. However, I needed an app that will show me exactly what the employee did at any moment and, specifically, what she printed. So, after a long search, I chose Clever Control. Clever Control recorded each instance of printing, and I could always look at screenshots to see what document the employee printed. Thanks to the live viewing feature, I could watch what she was doing on her computer on my monitoring dashboard.": "我有一个小型印刷企业。我们设计和印刷请柬、名片、贺卡、当地餐馆的菜单等等。我开始怀疑我的一名员工利用工作设备为她自己和她的亲戚打印个人文件。然而，我没有确凿的证据，而且其他员工也不愿意把她供出来。我开始寻找一种方法来跟踪她打印的内容和她在工作时间做的事情。我花了几个小时在互联网上搜索，却发现很少有软件能够为我的问题提供解决方案。大多数程序的重点是监控员工的生产力。例如，他们跟踪这个人完成了多少任务，以及他们在这些任务上花了多少时间。然而，我需要一个应用程序，它能准确地显示员工在任何时候做了什么，具体地说，她打印了什么。因此，经过长时间的搜索，我选择了Clever Control。Clever Control记录了每一次打印的情况，我可以随时查看屏幕截图，看看员工打印了什么文件。由于有实时查看功能，我可以在我的监控仪表板上看到她在电脑上做什么。",
    "After a couple of weeks of monitoring with Clever Control, I got the evidence that first, the employee in question printed out a 200 pages book she found on the Internet. Secondly, she designed and printed gilded invitations for her sister's wedding. But there was no such order among the ongoing ones in the company's records.": "在用Clever Control监控了几个星期后，我得到的证据是：首先，有关员工打印了一本她在网上找到的200页的书。其次，她为她妹妹的婚礼设计并打印了镀金的请柬。但在公司的记录中，没有这样的订单。",
    "That case ensured me that employee monitoring is essential. I have been using Clever Control for a few years now. It helps me to understand how the work is getting done and control the use of materials. The online monitoring feature is a treasure because I don't want to stress my employees by standing over their shoulders. I can receive all reports to my computer or see what the employees are doing without leaving the office. Very convenient!": "这个案例让我确信，员工监控是必不可少的。我使用Clever Control已经有几年了。它帮助我了解工作的完成情况并控制材料的使用。在线监控功能是个宝，因为我不想因为站在员工的肩膀上而给他们带来压力。我可以在不离开办公室的情况下，在我的电脑上收到所有的报告，或者看到员工在做什么。非常方便!",

We even organized a promotional campaign, but all of that brought little to no profit.": "我的餐馆的收入在几个月内不断下降，但我找不到任何合理的原因。看来，顾客的流量是稳定的。我密切控制着原料的质量和准备好的菜肴。我在菜单上增加了一些异国情调的菜，希望它们能吸引新的游客。我们甚至组织了一次促销活动，但所有这些都没有带来什么利润。",

Then he went back to the terminal, turned off the printer in the kitchen via the settings of his terminal and cancelled the order as if the customer refused it. After that, he turned back on the printer in the kitchen. This way, the cooks did not have confirmation that the order was cancelled, but the accountant did. The waiter accepted the payment from the customers in cash and kept it to himself.": "原来，其中一个服务员将订单输入了终端。订单的细节在厨房里被自动打印出来。厨师准备好订单后，该服务员将其提供给顾客。然后他回到终端，通过终端的设置关闭了厨房的打印机，并取消了订单，就像顾客拒绝了一样。之后，他又打开了厨房里的打印机。这样一来，厨师们没有确认订单被取消，但会计却确认了。服务员接受了顾客的现金付款，并将其据为己有。",

Sometimes I have to stay late after work because he often gives me too many tasks for such tight deadlines. Or I have to redo the work done by my colleagues on my own initiative because their botching affects my results too. Any talk to them was useless. One of my co-workers is 40 minutes late every morning and spends the day on coffee and gossiping with others, getting almost no work done! Our boss was often absent from the office, and he did not notice most of these issues. I was hesitant to go to him about these problems as I didn't want to look like a snitch. Over time it became unbearable for me to put up with all this, and I even started thinking of finding a new job.": "我永远不会相信我会这么说，但我很高兴我的老板在我们的电脑上安装了监控。有时，我不得不在下班后待到很晚，因为他经常在如此紧迫的期限内给我太多的任务。或者我不得不主动重做同事完成的工作，因为他们的错误也会影响我的成果。和他们的任何谈话都是无用的。我的一个同事每天早上都会迟到40分钟，一天都在喝咖啡和和别人闲聊中度过，几乎没有完成任何工作!我们的老板经常不在办公室，他没有注意到这些问题中的大部分。我很犹豫要不要去找他谈这些问题，因为我不想看起来像个告密者。随着时间的推移，我已经无法忍受这一切，我甚至开始考虑找一份新的工作。",
    "One day the boss informed us that he was going to install the monitoring software Clever Control on our computers. He explained that he wanted to re-organize the work in our department, and he needed more information about the usual work procedures.

A few worst slackers were fired, some others were given a second chance to improve.": "有一天，老板通知我们，他要在我们的电脑上安装监控软件Clever Control。他解释说，他想重新组织我们部门的工作，他需要更多关于平时工作程序的信息。经过几个月的监控，老板终于看到我做了多少工作（包括我同事的职责），并给我升职和奖金。几个最差的偷懒者被解雇了，其他一些人被给予第二次改进的机会。",
